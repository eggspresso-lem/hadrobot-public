All exam dates are in the syllabus on Canvas!
**Other than the syllabus**, ignore exam dates on Canvas. It likes to automatically generate dates on its own. They are PROBABLY WRONG!!
Finals are always on the last day of class/lecture - BEFORE finals week! 
I unfortunately cannot give you a hard date for the exams because it changes from quarter to quarter, but they're on the syllabus!
